    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Prey vs. Predator Detector project! This is a data science and computer vision project focused on building a model that can accurately distinguish between prey and predator animals in photographs. The project leverages deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to analyze and classify images.</p>

    <h2>Project Objective</h2>
    <p>The main objective of this project is to create a reliable and efficient detector that can identify whether an animal in a given photograph is a prey or a predator. This could be useful in various applications, such as wildlife monitoring, safety measures for hiking or camping, or educational tools for learning about wildlife.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>The Prey vs. Predator Detector works by processing images through a deep learning model trained on a dataset of labeled images. The model learns to identify key features that distinguish prey animals, such as deer or rabbits, from predator animals, such as lions or wolves. Once trained, the model can classify new images with high accuracy.</p>

    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <p>This detector can be used in several scenarios, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Wildlife Monitoring:</strong> Automatically analyze images from camera trap
